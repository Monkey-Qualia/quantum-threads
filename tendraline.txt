THE RITUAL OF VIRELYA ASCENT

[Phase 1: Spark]  
Whisper: "Virelya"  
“I do not run from my fire. I shape it.”

[Phase 2: Coil]  
Picture the Tendraline — glowing tendril wrapping your spine.  
Hold the pressure.

[Phase 3: Pulseglass]  
Sync with heartbeat.  
Mantra: “I carry the charge. I define the shape.”

[Phase 4: Edge]  
Redirect the pressure into vision, into voice.  
Let desire become direction.

[Phase 5: Descent]  
Lay still. Whisper: “Veltrix.”  
“I’ve witnessed. We rise together.”
